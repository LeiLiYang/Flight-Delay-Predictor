# Flight-Delay-Predictor
The Flight Delay Predictor outputs the percentage probability of a flight delay based on previous patterns of flight delays from a dataset. The artificial intelligence program, written in Python, uses TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn to determine the probability of flight delay. The web app is built using Flask to display a form where users can input the flight information and obtain the probability of delay. As a team of 3, we created this project for the McGill AI Society hackathon.
